This project involves the development of a Student Record Management System using Python. The system helps
manage student academic information, including personal details, enrolled courses, and grades. It allows for adding
new student records, updating or analyzing existing records, and generating outputs such as sorted lists of students
or summarized performance reports. The goal is to provide a convenient console-based application for academic
administrators or teachers to track student performance and perform operations like calculating grade averages or
identifying students meeting certain criteria.
The application is implemented in Python and leverages fundamental programming constructs taught in the course.
It makes use of basic data types (such as integers for IDs and grades, floats for GPA calculations, strings for names
and other text fields, and booleans for status flags) and employs expressions for arithmetic computations (e.g.,
summing grades to compute an average) and logical decisions. By utilizing Python's control structures (loops and
conditional statements) and organizing code into functions and classes, the project demonstrates a solid
understanding of introductory Python concepts while solving a real-world problem.
